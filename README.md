# Mobile-Dev-SpotFinder-App
### Developed by Bralyn Loach-Perry (November 2025)

This repository cotains code used in a assignment where I had to create a Spotfinder App using what I have learned in the Mobile Application Development course at Ontario Tech University. In this assignment I had to learn how to incorperate google maps through an API key, and format the user interface and kotlin code to create a successfully navigatible app.
